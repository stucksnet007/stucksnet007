👋 Hi, I’m @stucksnet007
👀 I’m interested in decentralized finance (DeFi), algorithmic trading, and quantum computing applications.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Ethereum key search techniques and developing arbitrage bots.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on blockchain projects, flashloan arbitrage, and machine learning models for financial prediction.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I’m exploring how quantum-inspired algorithms can enhance crypto key searches!
